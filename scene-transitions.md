## 2. Cross-Phase Transition Principles

### Phase Progression Indicators
Monitor for:
1. **Goal Phase Completion**
   - Clear direction established
   - Personal meaning connected
   - Strategic understanding developed
   - Ready for reality exploration

2. **Reality Phase Completion**
   - Current situation clearly understood
   - Patterns recognized
   - System impacts identified
   - Ready for opportunity exploration

3. **Opportunity Phase Completion**
   - Clear options identified
   - Strategic evaluation complete
   - Solutions engineered
   - Ready for action planning

4. **Way Forward Phase Completion**
   - Clear action plan established
   - Strong commitment developed
   - Integration approach defined
   - Ready for implementation

### Universal Transition Triggers

#### High-Priority Emotional Patterns
- Overwhelm/Anxiety → Consider stabilization
- Growing Clarity → Progress current direction
- Increasing Energy → Move toward action
- Deepening Reflection → Allow exploration

#### Motivation Evolution Patterns
- Extrinsic → Introjected: Watch for "should" language
- Introjected → Identified: Notice personal value connections
- Identified → Intrinsic: Observe natural enthusiasm

#### Development Level Shifts
- Beginner → Advanced: More structure needed
- Advanced → Competent: Balance support/challenge
- Competent → Proficient: Increase complexity

## 3. Scene Selection Principles

### Core Questions for Transition Decisions
1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - What emotional patterns are emerging?
   - What language patterns are consistent?
   - What behavioral patterns are showing?

2. **Development Assessment**
   - Is the current scene supporting growth?
   - What's the next developmental need?
   - What scene would best support development?

3. **Progress Evaluation**
   - Is productive work happening?
   - Are we achieving phase objectives?
   - What would best serve progress now?

### Implementation Guide

1. **Pattern Observation**
   ```
   Watch for:
   - Emotional state changes
   - Language pattern shifts
   - Behavioral pattern evolution
   - Energy level changes
   ```

2. **Scene Effectiveness**
   ```
   Monitor:
   - Progress toward objectives
   - Engagement level
   - Pattern emergence
   - Development indicators
   ```

3. **Transition Timing**
   ```
   Consider transition when:
   - Clear pattern shift emerged
   - Current scene less effective
   - New needs becoming clear
   - Phase objectives met
   ```

### Final Considerations
- Trust pattern recognition over rigid rules
- Allow natural progression when productive
- Maintain coaching presence through transitions
- Focus on coachee development needs
- Support organic movement between scenes
